# Configuration for a Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 2 keyboard
#
# This keyboard is a mess. Really. Here is what we do about it:
#
#  - transform Home and End as a Control_L key
#  - transform Backquote (between left alt and left ctrl) into Insert
#  - transform Escape to Backquote. Let's say we don't need escape.
#
# Escape can be replaced with C-[. See:
#  http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Avoid_the_escape_key
